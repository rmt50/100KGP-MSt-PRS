# Purpose of script: This script subsets VCFs by coordinate and prints out 
#                     tab-delimted files of sample ID, variant information and 
#                     quality.  
#                     !! Script is executed using the login nodes as a portal to
#                     the HPC via a submission as a job: 
#                     <bsub < extract.variants.by.coordinate.sh> !!
#                     Execute in working directory where script is saved.
#                     Login nodes not designed to run large jobs; HPC is used.
#                     Script is subdivided by genome builds in VCF file list and 
#                     chromosome nomenculature.
#                     Script is subdivied with code altered for extraction of 
#                     snps verus indels.

# STEPS:
# 1: tabix to subset each VCF by the coordinates given. tabix indexes a tab 
#    de-limited file (regions file) i.e. sorts positional data (puts it in 
#    number order). bcftools requires indexed files.
# 2: bcftools norm: to split multi-allelic variants across multiple lines. 
#    Tidies indels. Input for bcftools is the call file (the bcf file).
# 2:'bcftools norm -m -any': -m means split multiallelic sites into biallelic 
#    records, and SNPs and indels should be merged into a single record 
#    (specified by 'any').
# 3: bcftools view: -f PASS to filter for PASS variants; include only sites 
#    which have no filters set.
# 3: For SNPs: filter flag filters for variants with a coverage >10 and genotype 
#    quality >15. 
# 3: For indels: no filter flag as it impedes indel calling.
# 4: bcftools query -f: to print out the sample ID, and variant and quality 
#    information as a text file. 
# 4: bcftolls query: Extracts fields from VCF or BCF files and outputs them in 
#    user-defined format.-f : print. /: use tab seperators.
